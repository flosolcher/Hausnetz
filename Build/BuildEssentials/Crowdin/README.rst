Crowdin Translation Support
===========================

Crowdin (https://crowdin.net/) is an online localization management platform.
The tools in this folder allow to use it for Flow packages.

Configuration
-------------

You need to have the crowdin-cli tool installed, see https://crowdin.net/page/cli-tool.

Now create a JSON file in your project root, e.g. named ``crowdin.json``::

	{
		"acme-foo": {
			"name": "Acme Foo",
			"path": "Packages/Application/Acme.Foo",
			"apiKey": "<project api key>"
		},
		"acme-bar": {
			"name": "Acme Bar",
			"path": "Packages/Application/Acme.Bar",
			"apiKey": "<project api key>"
		}
	}

.. note:: You should never commit this to Git, as it contains your secret keys.

Now you can run::

	php Build/BuildEssentials/Setup.php `pwd`/crowdin.json

This will create ``crowdin.yaml`` in every project configured in ``crowdin.json``.

.. note:: You should exclude ``crowdin.yaml`` from Git, so it cannot be committed by
	accident (as it contains your secret keys)

Bundling projects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Instead of using a single Crowdin project per package, you ca also use bundling to have all
XLIFF files (sources and translations) be handled in a single Crowdin project. This allows
for better overview, uses a single translation memory and glossary and thus makes the life
of translators easier.

To use bundling, set up ``crowdin.json`` like above but include a special ``__bundle`` entry::

	{
		"__bundle": {
			"projectIdentifier": "<project identifier>",
			"apiKey": "<project api key>"
		},
		"acme-foo": {
			â€¦
		}
	}

The individual project entries can still have ``apiKey`` entries, they will be ignored.
Keeping them allows to reuse the same ``crowdin.json`` file for bundled and non-bundled
use (should that ever be needed).

Then call the setup script like this::

	php Build/BuildEssentials/Setup.php `pwd`/crowdin.json --bundle

Usage
-----

Now you can run::

	php Build/BuildEssentials/Upload.php `pwd`/crowdin.json

This will upload the source XLIFF files to Crowdin. Using::

	php Build/BuildEssentials/Upload.php `pwd`/crowdin.json --translations

sources and existing translations will be uploaded (synchronized) in one go.

Running this will download the translations from Crowdin::

	php Build/BuildEssentials/Download.php `pwd`/crowdin.json

This updates the XLIFF files with translations from Crowdin; review and commit as
you like.

All of the above commands can be called with ``--bundle`` to use project bundling::

	php Build/BuildEssentials/Upload.php `pwd`/crowdin.json --bundle
	php Build/BuildEssentials/Upload.php `pwd`/crowdin.json --bundle --translations
	php Build/BuildEssentials/Download.php `pwd`/crowdin.json --bundle

To remove all generated ``crowdin.yaml`` files again use::

	php Build/BuildEssentials/Teardown.php `pwd`/crowdin.json
