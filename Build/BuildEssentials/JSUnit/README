Enabling Buster.js Testing
==========================

Create a package.json file in the root of your distribution. You can use
``Build/buildessentials/JSUnit/Templates/package.json`` as example. Now create
a ``Build/JSUnit/buster.js`` file which will initialize your testing environment.
An example can be found in ``Build/buildessentials/JSUnit/Templates/buster.js``.
This file can then be used for a global project test run. For testing specific
packages you should add a buster.js file to the package.

Installing Buster.js
====================

npm install -g buster

Starting Buster.js
==================

npm run-script server

Running Tests
=============

npm test

Tips
====

* If you want to see all the resources published for testing by buster.js you can
  go to http://localhost:1111/resources

* To see which HTTP requests are done during the test run you can attach a browser
  using http://localhost:1111/attach and use your normal browser talks
